  "aboutUsContent": "Tedzvid.ba is an electronic, interactive version of the printed Tajweed authored by Mr. Sejid ef. Strike. This Tajweed aims to help new learners of the Quran, including students in traditional Islamic schools and adults, to better understand and master the basic rules of Tajweed. Its simple vocabulary and avoidance of technical terms, as much as possible, make it more accessible to a wider readership.<br><br>The special feature of the tedzvid.ba website is its interactive examples, where you can listen to the audio recording by clicking on it, and the video recording after the exercise will help you better understand the Tajweed rule you want to learn. We hope that tedzvid.ba will help teachers in explaining Tajweed rules to children in Islamic schools and to adults after completing their Quranic recitation.",
