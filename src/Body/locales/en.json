This tajweed aims to help the reciters of the Qur&#39;an, students attending the maktab (Islamic school for children) as well as adults, master basic tajweed recitation rules easily. The use of simple vocabulary and avoidance of expert terminology, whenever possible, make it accessible to a wider readership.<br><br>The distinctive feature of this page is interactive examples, the audio of which you can listen to by clicking on it, and the video following each practical exercise will help you understand the tajweed rule you want to master more easily.
